## Portfolio Project: Employee Attrition Analysis

In this project, I will be analyzing employee attrition data to gain insights into factors that contribute to employee turnover within a company. I will be working with a database that contains a table for employee information and attrition details. My goal is to identify patterns and trends related to attrition and provide actionable insights to address the issue.

**Dataset:** Dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/employee-attrition-and-factors) under a [CC0:Public Domain license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).  

**Languages:** SQL  

**Tools:** MySQL, Excel  

**Initial Data Exploration:**
Write SQL queries to analyze the employee attrition data:
   - Calculate the overall attrition rate for the company.
   - Identify the departments or teams with the highest attrition rates.
   - Determine the average tenure of employees who left the company.
   - Analyze the distribution of attrition by gender, age, marital status and job level.
   - Investigate if there are any correlations between attrition and factors such as performance ratings, salary, or work life balance.
